  Test rig

    ✔ Test rig for parsing is correctly wired to the module's API.

  Unquoted values

    ✔ Handles basic unquoted assignment.
    ✔ Ignores non-assignments.
    ✔ Accepts multiple assignments at the start of a single line.
    ✔ Ignores assignment-like statements once a non-assignment has been encountered.

  'export' Prefix

    ✔ Accepts optional 'export' prefix at the start of assignment.
    ✔ Only allows at most 1 optional prefix.
    ✔ Accepts multiple lines that have been prefixed with 'export'.
    ✔ Still allows assignment of a variable that's named 'export'.
    ✔ Still allows assignment of a variable (that is exported) that is also named 'export'.

  Escaping with backslashes

    ✔ Removes backslash-newline combination.
    ✔ Preserves literal value of character following a backslash.
    ✔ Allows escaping of the space character in an unquoted value.
    ✔ Removes backslash-newline combinations even in the left side of an assignment.
    ✔ Does not otherwise work in the left side of an assignment.

  Basic Parameter expansion

    ✔ Handles basic parameter expansion (unbraced).
    ✔ Handles basic parameter expansion (braced).
    ✔ Handles unbraced parameter expansion with literal prefix.
    ✔ Handles braced parameter expansion with literal suffix.
    ✔ Handles demarcating the end of a variable name with a backslash in an unbraced expansion.
    ✔ Does not expand if $-char is escaped.
    ✔ Does not expand if opening brace is escaped.

  Escaping with single-quotes

    ✔ Does not include surrounding quotes in final value.
    ✔ Treats spaces and tabs literally.
    ✔ Treats newlines literally.
    ✔ Prevents backslash-escaping.
    ✔ Treats all other symbol characters (except single-quotes) literally.

  Escaping with double-quotes

    ✔ Does not include surrounding quotes in final value.
    ✔ Treats spaces and tabs literally.
    ✔ Treats newlines literally.
    ✔ Removes backslash-newline combination.
    ✔ Allows backslash-escaping of double-quotes.
    ✔ Allows backslash-escaping of $-signs.
    ✔ Allows backslash-escaping of backslashes.
    ✔ Does not otherwise do backslash-escaping (i.e. preserves backslash literal).

  Intense combinations of the above

    ✔ Combo (incl. quoted element concatenation).
    ✔ Combo (incl. expected single-quoted usage and escaping).
    ✔ Combo (incl. quote literals in expanded parameters).

  Comments

    ✔ Ignores full-line comments ('#' at start of line).
    ✔ Ignores same-line comments (upon seeing space-hash (i.e. ' #') till end of line).
    ✔ Doesnt't treat backslash-escaped space-hash as start of commentary.
    ✔ Doesnt't treat space-hash within single-quotes as start of commentary.
    ✔ Doesnt't treat space-hash within double-quotes as start of commentary.

  Handling missing input

    ✔ 0-arg: Logs a warning when default `.env` file can't be found.
    ✔ string-arg: Throws an error if the specified path can't be found.
    ✔ opts-arg: Logs a warning if file was not found and `path` was unspecified.
    ✔ opts-arg: Throws an error if file was not found and `path` was specified.
    ✔ Always remains silent when `enoent` is overriden to null.
    ✔ Always logs a warning when `enoent` is overriden to 'warn'.
    ✔ Throws an error when `enoent` is overriden to 'error' (path unspecified).
    ✔ Throws an error when `enoent` is overriden to 'error' (path specified).

  Overriding existing variables

    ✔ Overrides all existing variables by default.
    ✔ Overrides all existing variables when `override` is set to 'all'.
    ✔ Overrides empty variables only when `override` is set to 'empty'.
    ✔ Does not override existing variables when `override` is set to 'none'.
    ✔ Overrides based on the boolean result of an arbitrary function assigned to `override`.
    ✔ Throws an error when `override` is set to a bogus string value.

  Composite test

    ✔ Successfully handles an example envfile.
